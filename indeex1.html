                <li><b>Background</b></li><p>The <u>Indian cricket team</u> has a rich history, evolving from its introduction by <del>European sailors</del> in the 18th century to becoming a global powerhouse.

Bowlers have limits on overs they can bowl, and batsmen aim to score as many runs as possible. A team wins by scoring more runs than the opponent. Fielding restrictions, powerplays, DRS (Decision Review System), and rules for no-balls and wides apply. In case of tied scores, Super Overs are used in limited-overs matches</p>
            <li><b>Prize money</b></li><p>prize money is awarded to the winning and runner-up teams, with the champion team getting the highest share. Other awards include cash for Player of the Match, Player of the Tournament, Best Bowler, Best Batter, and more</p>
