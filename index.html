                <li>Background</li><p>The Indian cricket team has a rich history, evolving from its introduction by European sailors in the 18th century to becoming a global powerhouse. Initially, the team struggled, taking nearly 20 years to secure its first Test victory.</p>
                <li>Foundation</li><p>The foundation of a cricket team involves several key aspects: establishing a governing body, defining player roles and responsibilities, and fostering a positive team environment. The governing body, like the BCCI in India, sets rules, organizes matches, and manages the overall structure of the sport.</p>
                <li>Expansion and termination</li><p>Cricket team expansion and termination are common occurrences, often driven by factors like financial viability, talent development, and market demand. </p>

            <li>Tournament format</li><p>The knockout format is simpleâ€”teams play matches where the loser is eliminated, and the winner advances. In a round-robin format, each team plays against all other teams, and points are awarded for wins or ties. A double round-robin is similar but teams play each other twice. </p>
            <li>Player acquisition, squad composition and salaries</li><p>player acquisition happens through auctions or drafts, where teams bid for players within a set budget. Squad composition rules often include a limit on overseas players and a minimum number of local or uncapped players.</p>
            <li>Match rules</li><p>Test, ODI, or T20. Each team gets one or two innings depending on the format. In ODIs, each team plays 50 overs; in T20s, it's 20 overs. Bowlers have limits on overs they can bowl, and batsmen aim to score as many runs as possible. A team wins by scoring more runs than the opponent. Fielding restrictions, powerplays, DRS (Decision Review System), and rules for no-balls and wides apply. In case of tied scores, Super Overs are used in limited-overs matches</p>
            <li>Prize money</li><p>prize money is awarded to the winning and runner-up teams, with the champion team getting the highest share. Other awards include cash for Player of the Match, Player of the Tournament, Best Bowler, Best Batter, and more</p>
